# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to your journey into the exciting world of physical AI and humanoid robotics! This comprehensive 8-week course will take you from foundational concepts to building your own intelligent robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the fundamentals of physical AI and how it differs from traditional software
- **Work with** sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers
- **Program** robots using Python, Arduino, and industry-standard frameworks
- **Implement** computer vision and sensor fusion techniques
- **Design** motion planning algorithms for robotic systems
- **Build** a complete robotic project from concept to demonstration

## Course Structure

This course is organized into 4 modules, each spanning 2 weeks:

### Module 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
Build your understanding of physical AI concepts, learn about essential hardware components, and set up your development environment.

### Module 2: Sensors (Weeks 3-4)
Dive deep into the world of sensors - how robots perceive their environment through various sensing modalities including computer vision.

### Module 3: Actuators (Weeks 5-6)
Learn how robots interact with the physical world through motors, servos, and other actuators. Master kinematics and motion planning.

### Module 4: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
Bring everything together in a capstone project that demonstrates your ability to build complete robotic systems.

## Who Is This Course For?

This course is designed for:

- **Beginners** with basic programming knowledge who want to enter robotics
- **Software developers** looking to expand into physical computing
- **Hobbyists** interested in building intelligent machines
- **Students** pursuing robotics or mechatronics studies

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (any language)
- High school level mathematics
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment!

## Learning Approach

Our teaching philosophy centers on **hands-on learning**. Each lesson includes:

- 📖 **Conceptual explanations** - Understanding the "why" behind techniques
- 💻 **Code examples** - Practical implementations you can run
- 🔧 **Hands-on exercises** - Apply what you've learned
- ✅ **Knowledge checks** - Verify your understanding
- 🎯 **Mini-projects** - Build real components for your final project

## Required Hardware

While simulation options are available, we recommend having access to:

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi Pico
- **Basic sensors**: Ultrasonic sensor, IR sensors, IMU
- **Actuators**: DC motors, servo motors
- **Optional**: Raspberry Pi 4, camera module

Don't worry if you don't have all the hardware - we'll discuss alternatives and simulators that can help you learn.
